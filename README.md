# HELLOOOOOOO!!!

My name is **Andriy**! I am very glad that I can learn programming with you all.\
I have the following programming skills:
* HTML, CSS, SCSS
* JavaScript
* React
* Node JS: Express and Nest JS (basic)
* MySQL, Postgress, Mongo DB (basic)

## Git та GitHub
>In this part of the software lesson, I learned a lot of interesting and useful new things for myself.
>For example, I learned about **`diff`** and **`patch`**, which I hadn't used before. There is also an interactive game about **`git`** that is quite educational, allowing you to learn about the *VSC* ecosystem in a simple yet insightful way.
>
>But learning on Coursera is very boring and doesn't really cover everything in my opinion. There are much more interesting and useful materials on other resources on the Internet.
>
>Although the game is quite high-quality and interestingly made, I am convinced that this method of learning is more confusing, because in combat realities everything is much different

>A very interestingly designed program for Linux teams in [Linux Survival](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/). But in my opinion, many things are underused and need more for some sysadmins. 
>In any case, the information was new to me and quite useful in places.
>
>Articles about HHTP protocols that are provided for review are, in my opinion, very difficult to understand and I do not consider them correct at the beginning for a programmer. So you need to know about this protocol, but not in this form, for example, a video would be more visual. 
>About 30% of the information a beginner programmer needs here. Therefore, I had to look for the video myself and understand a little more about this topic

>Although I don't like the coursera platform, the material presented for this topic is quite structured and useful. I learned a lot of new things and will probably use some of them myself, because it is convenient. For example, the `git commit -a -m "message..."` command allows you to immediately add an index and write a message instead of two separate commands `git add .` and `git commit -m "message..."`

>I really disliked this interactive git game. Very confusing commands, invented in places, as well as commands that are rarely needed, especially at the beginning. I wouldn't recommend this site as a way to get started with `git`, there are better resources, the same youtube videos or different articles.

>Since I have a basic `HTML` and `CSS` background, this stuff didn't teach me much. But it was quite interesting to listen to some moments, for example, from the history of its origin, and I also want to highlight well-structured material.

>Pretty basic study but very cool structured and organized. I think for beginners this resource will be one of the best for gradually learning `HTML` and `CSS`.
