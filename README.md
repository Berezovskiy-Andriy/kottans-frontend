> In this part of the software lesson, I learned a lot of interesting and useful new things for myself.
> For example, I learned about `diff` and `patch`, which I hadn't used before. There is also an interactive game about `git` that is quite > educational, allowing you to learn about the *VSC* ecosystem in a simple yet insightful way.
>
> But learning on Coursera is very boring and doesn't really cover everything in my opinion. There are much more interesting and useful > materials on other resources on the Internet.

> Although the game is quite high-quality and interestingly made, I am convinced that this method of learning is more confusing, because in > combat realities everything is much different
